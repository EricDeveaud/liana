Stats:
1) The ‘weight_norm’ edge attribute is derived from the normalized expression
 of the ligand and the receptor in the single-cell data.
2) The ‘weight_scale’ edge attribute is derived from the z-scores of the ligand
 and the receptor in each edge, and is of higher value when the ligand and receptor
  are more specific to a given pair of cell types
3) DEG p-values for L and R
