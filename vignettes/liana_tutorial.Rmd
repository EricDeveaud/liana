# `liana`: Intro

The continuous developments of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) have sparked an
immense interest in understanding intercellular crosstalk. Multiple tools and
resources that aid the investigation of cell-cell communication (CCC) were 
published recently. However, these methods and resources are usually in a fixed
combination of a tool and its corresponding resource, but in principle any
resource could be combined with any method.

To this end, we built `liana` - a framework to decouple the tools from their
corresponding resources.

## Load required packages
```{r load_pkgs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(liana)
require(tibble)
require(purrr)
```

## CCC Resources
`liana` provides CCC resources obtained and formatted via [`OmnipathR`](https://github.com/saezlab/OmnipathR) which are then converted to the appropriate format to each method.
```{r liana_resource, warning = FALSE}
# Resource currently included in OmniPathR (and hence `liana`) include:
get_resources()

# A list of resources can be obtained using the `select_resource()` function:
# See `?select_resource()` documentation for further information.
# select_resource(c('OmniPath')) %>% glimpse() 
```
  
  
## CCC Methods
Each of the resources, can then be run with any of the following methods:
```
- CellPhoneDB algorithm (via Squidpy)
- CellChat
- NATMI
- Connectome
- SingleCellSignalR (SCA)
- iTALK
```

## Calling the `liana` wrapper function

To run `liana`, we will use a toy PBMCs scRNA-Seq data set
`liana` takes `Seurat` objects as input, containing processed counts and clustered cells
```{r load_data}
liana_path <- system.file(package = "liana")
testdata <-
    readRDS(file.path(liana_path , "testdata", "input", "testdata.rds"))

testdata %>% glimpse()
```

`liana_wrap` calls a number of methods and and each method is run with the provided resources.

Here, we call Connectome and Squidpy for the sake of computational speed,
but any of c("sca", "natmi", "italk", "cellchat") can also be run by simply
adding their name to the `method` parameter.

Similarly, here we use only the "OmniPath" CCC resource, but any of the 
aforementioned ones (available via `get_resources()`) can be added to the `resource` parameter
```{r liana_run, message = FALSE, print = FALSE, results='hide'}
# Run liana
liana_test <- liana_wrap(testdata,
                         method = c('squidpy', 'connectome'),
                         resource = c('OmniPath'))
```



## Obtain Consensus Ranks
`liana` also provides consensus ranks for the results obtained using different
methods. By default, liana will provide mean, median, and a aggregate* consensus
ranks
```{r liana_ranks, message = FALSE, print = FALSE}
# Liana returns a list of results, each element of which corresponds to a method
liana_test

# We can aggregate these results into a dataframe with consensus ranks
liana_test %>%
  liana_aggregate()
```
*The aggregate consnesus rank is obtained using the RobustRankAggreg package.
The RobustRankAggreg package provides different functions to obtain aggregate
ranks, by default the [`RRA`](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278763/) method is used.
RRA provides rank scores which can be interpreted as p-values. Interactions which
ranked consistently higher than random are assigned low scores/p-values.


## Call `liana` with overwritten default settings
By default `liana` is run with the default for each method which can be obtained via `liana_default()`

Alternatively, one can also overwrite the default settings by simply passing them to the liana wrapper function
```{r liana_params, message = FALSE, print = FALSE}
# Overwrite CellChat default parameters by providing a list of parameters
liana_test <- liana_wrap(testdata,
                         method = c('cellchat', 'squidpy'),
                         resource = 'Default', # Run with Default Resources
                         cellchat.params = 
                           list(
                             nboot = 10,
                             exclude_anns = NULL,
                             thresh = 1,
                             assay = "RNA",
                             .normalize = TRUE,
                             .do_parallel = FALSE,
                             .raw_use = TRUE
                             )
                         )

# This returns a list of results for each method
liana_test %>% glimpse
```
###### Information about the parameters passed to each method can be obtained via
`call_*` functions - e.g. ?call_cellchat or ?call_squidpy



## Call a method alone
To call a any single method, you can use any of the `call_*` methods:
```{r liana_call}
# RUN cellchat alone with OmniPath
cc_res <- call_cellchat(
  seurat_object = testdata,
  op_resource = select_resource('OmniPath')[[1]],
  .normalize = TRUE,
  nboot = 10)

# Show CellChat Results
cc_res
```
