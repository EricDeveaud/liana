# `liana`: Intro and Tutorial

The continuous developments of single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) have sparked an immense interest in understanding intercellular crosstalk. Multiple tools and resources that aid the investigation of cell-cell communication (CCC) were published recently. However, these methods and resources are usually in a fixed combination of a tool and its corresponding resource, but in principle any resource could be combined with any method.

To this end we built `liana` - a framework to decouple the tools from their corresponding resources.

## CCC Resources
`liana` provides CCC resources obtained and formatted via [`OmnipathR`](https://github.com/saezlab/OmnipathR) which are then converted to the appropriate format to each method.
```{r liana_resource, warning = FALSE}
# Resource currently included in OmniPathR (and hence `liana`) include:
get_resources()

# A list of resources can be obtained using the `select_resource()` function:
select_resource(c('OmniPath')) %>%
  glimpse()
```
  
  
## CCC Methods
Each of the resources, can then be run with any of the following methods:
+ CellPhoneDB algorithm (via Squidpy)
+ CellChat
+ NATMI
+ Connectome
+ SingleCellSignalR (SCA)
+ iTALK


## Calling the `liana` wrapper function

To run `liana`, we will use a toy PBMCs scRNA-Seq data set
`liana` takes `Seurat` objects as input, containing processed counts and clustered cells
```{r load_data , echo=FALSE}
liana_path <- system.file(package = "liana")
testdata <-
    readRDS(file.path(liana_path , "testdata", "input", "testdata.rds"))

testdata %>% glimpse()
```

`liana_wrap` calls a number of methods and and each method is run with the provided resources.

Here, we will call SingleCellSignalR (SCA) and Squidpy for the sake of computational speed,
but any of c("natmi", "connectome", "italk", "cellchat") can also be run by simply adding their name to the `method` parameter

Similarly, here we use only the "OmniPath" CCC resource, but any of the 
aforementioned ones (available via `get_resources()`) can be added to the `resource` parameter
```{r liana_run, message = FALSE, print = FALSE}
# Run liana
liana_test <- liana_wrap(testdata,
                         method = c('sca', 'squidpy'),
                         resource = c('OmniPath'))

# liana returns a list of results for each method
liana_test %>% glimpse
```

## Call `liana` with overwritten default settings
In the previous example `liana` was run with the default for each method which can be obtained via `liana_default()`

Alternatively, one can also overwrite the default settings by simply passing them to the liana wrapper function
```{r liana_params, message = FALSE, print = FALSE}
# Overwrite SCA default parameters by providing a list of parameters for the method
# Information about the parameters passed to each method can be obtained via
# `call_*` functions - e.g. ?call_sca or ?call_squidpy
liana_test <- liana_wrap(testdata,
                         method = c('sca', 'squidpy'),
                         resource = c('OmniPath'),
                         sca.params = list(
                           assay = "RNA",
                           .format = FALSE, # don't format according to liana
                           s.score = 0,
                           logFC = log2(1.5)))

# This returns a list of results for each method
liana_test %>% glimpse
```



## Call a single method
To call a any single method, you can use any of the `call_*` methods:
```{r liana_call}
# RUN cellchat alone with OmniPath
cc_res <- call_cellchat(
  seurat_object = testdata,
  op_resource = select_resource('OmniPath')[[1]],
  .normalize = TRUE,
  nboot = 10)

# Show CellChat Results
cc_res %>% glimpse
```
